Course Description: This course focuses on developmental research with a focus on learning and technology. By becoming members of the Cognitive and Developmental Science Lab, students will engage in the various stages of research. Research activities include conducting literature reviews, recruiting subjects, designing stimuli for experimental research, collecting data (e.g., observing children at preschools or labs), entering data, coding audio/video recordings (e.g., behaviors and eye movements), cleaning and analyzing data, and presenting results in various formats (lab meetings or undergraduate research conference). In addition to gaining firsthand knowledge and experiences about child learning and development, students will also acquire technical and practical skills that can be used in other avenues of research (critical thinking, oral and written presentations, collaboration, personal responsibility).
